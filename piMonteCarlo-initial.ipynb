        "1.  **Considering this problem recursively, what happens each recursive call (until the base case)? The same thing, over and over? Consider your iterative solution. And what is the base case (how do you stop the recursion)?**\n",
        "    In each recursive call of the multiplication function `recursiveMultiply(num1, num2)`, `num1` is added to the result of multiplying `num1` by (`num2 - 1`). This process effectively adds `num1` repeatedly. This is similar to the iterative solution which would also repeatedly add `num1` `num2` times, but it manages the process with a loop and variables instead of function calls. The base case that stops the recursion is when `num2` becomes 0, at which point the function returns 0, as any number multiplied by zero is zero.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **What happens if one, or both, of your inputs are large (over 15000)? You should get an error. Does this make sense? What implications does this have for recursive algorithm efficiency?**\n",
        "    Yes, if one or both inputs are very large (e.g., over 15000), a stack overflow error is likely to occur. This happens because each recursive call adds a new frame to the call stack. With large inputs, the depth of the recursive calls becomes very large, exceeding the limited memory allocated for the call stack. This makes sense because recursion, in this implementation, directly translates the multiplication operation into a large number of function calls, each consuming stack memory. This has significant implications for recursive algorithm efficiency, particularly concerning memory usage. While recursion can be elegant, it can be less memory-efficient than iterative solutions for problems requiring a large number of steps due to the overhead of managing the call stack, making iterative solutions often preferable for large inputs to avoid stack overflow.\n",

        "*   For practical applications involving potentially large inputs, an iterative approach to multiplication without the `*` operator (using a loop for repeated addition) would be more robust than the recursive solution presented, as it avoids the risk of stack overflow.\n",
